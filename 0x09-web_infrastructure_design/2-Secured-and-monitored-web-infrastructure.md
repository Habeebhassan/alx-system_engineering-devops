### Description
Imagine you're setting up a three-server infrastructure to host the website www.foobar.com. It's like building a house with three rooms, each serving the same purpose but working together to make the website run smoothly and securely.

1. **Web Servers (The Rooms):**
    - These are like the rooms in the house where all the action happens.
    - Each room has its own set of tools and equipment to handle visitors (web server software, application server, etc.).
    - We've put locks on the doors (firewalls) to keep out any unwanted guests or troublemakers.

2. **Load Balancer (The Reception Desk):**
    - Think of this as the reception desk where visitors first arrive.
    - It's responsible for directing visitors (traffic) evenly to the rooms (web servers).
    - Also, it takes care of checking IDs (SSL certificates) to ensure everyone's safety.

3. **Firewalls (The Security Guards):**
    - These are like the security guards stationed at each room's entrance.
    - They keep an eye on who's coming in and going out, making sure only authorized people get through.
    - If someone's causing trouble, they step in and handle the situation.

4. **SSL Certificate (The Secret Code):**
    - This is like a secret code that only the website and its visitors know.
    - It scrambles all the information exchanged between them so nobody else can understand it.
    - It's like speaking in code to keep conversations private.

5. **Monitoring Clients (The Observers):**
    - These are like the people walking around the house, keeping an eye on things.
    - They collect information about how everything's running (performance metrics, error logs, etc.).
    - If something seems off, they let us know so we can fix it before it becomes a big problem.

Issues with the setup:

1. **Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level (The Weak Link):**
    - Imagine if the reception desk decoded all the secret messages before passing them on.
    - It could be risky if someone were eavesdropping between the desk and the rooms.

2. **Single MySQL Server Accepting Writes (The Bottleneck):**
    - Picture a single water tap supplying water to the whole house.
    - If it breaks or gets overwhelmed, nobody can use water anymore.

3. **Uniform Server Components (The Vulnerability):**
    - It's like having all your eggs in one basket.
    - If something goes wrong with one part of the setup, it could affect everything else.
    - Having a bit more variety could make the setup more robust and adaptable.
