Postmortem: Web Application Outage on May 10, 2024
Issue Summary
Duration of the Outage: May 10, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM (UTC)
Impact: Our web application was completely down for an hour and a half, leaving all users unable to access the site. During this time, users encountered a "503 Service Unavailable" error, disrupting their experience and causing frustration.
Root Cause: A misconfigured load balancer caused all incoming traffic to be routed to a single server. This server became overwhelmed and crashed, leading to the service outage.
Timeline
10:00 AM: Our monitoring system detected a spike in error rates and alerted the on-call engineer via PagerDuty.
10:05 AM: The on-call engineer began investigating the issue by checking web server logs.
10:10 AM: Noticing an unusual surge in traffic, the engineer initially suspected a possible DDoS attack.
10:20 AM: After ruling out a DDoS attack, the engineer escalated the issue to the network operations team.
10:30 AM: The network operations team identified a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings.
10:40 AM: The misconfiguration was fixed, and all web servers were rebooted to restore normal operations.
11:00 AM: Traffic started to distribute evenly across servers, and the service began to recover.
11:30 AM: Full service was restored, and the incident was officially closed.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The load balancer had been recently updated, but an error in the configuration caused it to send all traffic to a single server. This server couldn't handle the load and crashed, leading to the site-wide outage.
Resolution:
The load balancer configuration was corrected to ensure it distributed traffic evenly across all servers.
All affected servers were rebooted to clear any issues caused by the overload.
We closely monitored the system to confirm that the service was fully restored and stable.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
What We Can Improve: To prevent such incidents in the future, we need to enhance our deployment process, monitoring, and team training.
Specific Tasks:
Review and Patch Load Balancer Configuration: Audit the current configuration and make necessary corrections.
Implement Load Distribution Monitoring: Set up monitoring to detect any uneven traffic distribution in real-time.
Enhance Deployment Scripts: Update deployment scripts to include checks for load balancer settings.
Provide Additional Training: Conduct training sessions for the operations team on managing and configuring load balancers.
Streamline Incident Response: Review and improve our incident response process to ensure quicker diagnosis and resolution.
Conduct a Post-Incident Review: Hold a meeting to discuss the incident, share lessons learned, and plan additional preventive measures.
By addressing these areas, we aim to strengthen our systemâ€™s resilience, ensuring that our web application remains reliable and accessible to all users. This incident highlighted the importance of thorough testing and monitoring, and we are committed to improving our processes to prevent future disruptions.
